# web-crawler-puppeteer
Simple web crawler built with puppeteer and express.

Do ```npm install``` before starting the project.

By running ```npm run start``` command, the express server will be initialized.

From the browser you can make a get request for start the puppeteer crawler.

Example: http://localhost:3000/crawl?website=https://quotes.toscrape.com/
I suggest you using https://quotes.toscrape.com/ for testing.
